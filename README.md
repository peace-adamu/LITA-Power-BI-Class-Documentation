## ## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the following individuals and organizations for their support and guidance throughout this project:
First and foremost, I acknowledge the Ladies in Tech Africa organization through the Incubator Hub for providing the platform and resources necessary to develop my skills in Excel and data analysis. Their commitment to empowering women in technology is truly inspiring.
I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to my tutor, Mr. Temidayo TeeDee his expertises, patiences, and dedications were instrumental in my success. Also his guidances were invaluable, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from him.

## Overview: In our Power BI class, we focused on importing, cleaning, and visualizing data to uncover insightful patterns and trends. This process involved detailed data manipulation and the creation of effective visual representations to aid in data analysis.

### Key Activities:
1. Table Creation:
Defined columns such as Age Range, Average Year of Birth, Email Address, Gender, Marital Status, Name, Upper Class, and Year of Birth.
2. Data Insights:
Identified the Average Year of Birth in the dataset, which was 1997.
3. Data Import and Cleaning:
- Imported the dataset and performed comprehensive cleaning including:
- Case conversion (upper, lower, proper)
- Using the Trim function to remove unnecessary spaces
- Removing blank rows and changing data types
- Promoting header and renaming columns
- Removing unnecessary columns and duplicating others where needed
- Transforming text to lower case and reordering columns
- Merging columns for streamlined analysis
4. Data Visualization:
- Created various tables to display:
- Region and Region Number
- Region and Units Sold
- Region and Revenue
- Market and Units Sold
- High, Low, and Medium categories based on Transaction Category
5. Map Visualization:
- Utilized Power BI's map visualization capabilities to display state data, providing a geographical perspective on the dataset.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this HR attrition analysis project is to utilize Power BI to analyze and understand the reasons behind employee turnover within the organization. By focusing on the factors contributing to attrition and the rate of attrition, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can help develop strategies to reduce employee departures and improve retention rates.

## Significance:
- Identifying Attrition Drivers: The analysis aims to uncover the key reasons why employees are leaving the organization, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, management issues, or career advancement opportunities.
- Attrition Rate Analysis: Understanding the rate of attrition across different departments, job roles, and demographics helps in identifying patterns and high-risk areas that require immediate attention.
- Cost Reduction: High turnover rates are costly. By addressing the root causes of attrition, the organization can save on recruitment, training, and onboarding costs.
- Enhanced Employee Retention: By pinpointing the factors leading to attrition, the organization can implement targeted interventions to retain valuable employees, improving overall workforce stability.
- Improved Employee Satisfaction: Addressing the reasons behind attrition can lead to enhanced job satisfaction, creating a more positive and productive work environment.
- Strategic HR Decisions: Data-driven insights from the attrition analysis support strategic HR planning and decision-making, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and improving HR policies and practices.
- Proactive Management: Early identification of potential attrition risks allows for proactive management and intervention, preventing large-scale turnover and its associated impacts.
- Workforce Optimization: A stable and satisfied workforce is more productive and engaged, contributing to the organization's success and competitive advantage.
